Have you ever cleared an important screening round only to trip up in the actual interview? It’s a frustrating experience, especially when the stakes are high. You’re not alone in feeling the pressure. Many candidates face similar challenges, and it’s completely normal to feel a mix of excitement and anxiety. Let’s talk about what happened in your situation and how to bounce back effectively.

## The Pressure of the Interview

When you cleared the screening round for the Software Member of Technical Staff (SMTS) role at Oracle Cloud, it must have felt like a huge victory. The promise of a great compensation package and stock options can be incredibly motivating. Yet, as you mentioned, when it came time for the data structures and algorithms (DSA) interview, things didn’t go as planned. 

Feeling frozen in a high-stakes situation is something many of us can relate to. The interview environment can be intimidating, and it’s easy to get flustered, especially with questions you know you’ve mastered before. The pressure can make even the simplest problems feel insurmountable. 

## Recognizing Common Challenges

You mentioned struggling with Kadane’s algorithm, a common problem that many software engineers encounter during interviews. It’s frustrating to know the material but still feel stuck when it matters most. This situation often arises because of a lack of recent practice, especially when you’ve been focusing on other areas like Graphs and Dynamic Programming (DP). 

It's important to remember that interviews are as much about mental agility and problem-solving under pressure as they are about knowledge. The reality is that even seasoned engineers can falter during interviews. This doesn’t define your skills or your worth as a candidate.

## The Guilt Factor

Feeling guilty about not performing your best can be a heavy burden. It’s easy to spiral into self-doubt, thinking you’ve let a great opportunity slip through your fingers. But remember, this is just one interview. Many successful engineers have faced setbacks and learned from them. What matters is how you choose to respond to this experience. 

Take a moment to reflect on what went wrong. Did nerves get the best of you? Did you struggle with a specific type of question? Understanding the root of your performance can help you prepare better for the next round. 

## Strategies for Improvement

Now, let’s focus on moving forward. You have two more interviews coming up, and there’s still plenty of time to prepare. Here are some strategies to help you regain your confidence and perform at your best:

### 1. Structured Practice

Create a structured study plan that balances your focus areas. While it’s essential to strengthen your Graphs and DP skills, don’t neglect the basics. Dedicate time each week to revisit fundamental algorithms and data structures. 

Consider using resources like our Data Structures and Algorithms course. This program offers 1-on-1 coaching tailored to your skill level, allowing you to address any knowledge gaps efficiently. Engaging with a coach can also provide insights into common pitfalls and how to avoid them in an interview setting.

### 2. Mock Interviews

Simulate the interview experience with mock interviews. Practicing with a friend or a mentor can help you build confidence and get accustomed to the interview format. This exercise can also help you manage nerves better. 

By practicing under timed conditions, you can train your mind to think clearly and quickly, even when the pressure is on. You might find that your knowledge flows more readily when you're in a familiar setting.

### 3. Focus on Problem-Solving Techniques

When tackling problems like Kadane’s algorithm, focus on breaking the problem down into smaller, manageable parts. Discussing your thought process aloud can also help interviewers understand your reasoning, even if you hit a mental block. 

Practicing this technique can make you feel more comfortable during technical interviews. Try explaining your approach and reasoning aloud while you work through practice problems. This strategy can help reinforce your understanding and clarify your thought process.

### 4. Learn from Experience

After each interview, take time to reflect on what went well and what didn’t. Journaling your experiences can help you identify patterns in your performance and areas where you can improve. 

You might also consider reviewing commonly asked interview questions and practicing them in a low-pressure environment. Understanding how others tackle these problems can provide you with new strategies and perspectives that might resonate with you.

## Preparing for the Upcoming Rounds

With two more rounds on the horizon, it’s crucial to focus on preparation and mindset. The technical round will likely cover similar DSA topics, so ensure you’re practicing relevant problems. It can also be beneficial to brush up on system design concepts for the techno-manager round.

### Addressing Both Technical and Managerial Aspects

In the techno-manager round, be prepared to discuss how you approach technical challenges from a managerial perspective. Think about how you can leverage your technical skills while also demonstrating leadership qualities. 

You might want to reflect on past experiences where you led a project or solved a complex problem. Being able to articulate your thought process and decisions can set you apart from other candidates.

## Embracing the Learning Journey

It’s important to remember that every interview is a learning opportunity. Even if things don’t go as planned, you’ll gain valuable insights that will help you in future interviews. Don’t let one setback define your journey. 

Take the lessons learned from your recent experience and apply them to your upcoming interviews. Each time you practice, you are actively investing in your growth and development as a software engineer.

## Final Thoughts

Feeling guilty about your past performance is common, but it’s crucial to move forward with a positive mindset. You cleared the screening round for a reason, and you have the skills needed to succeed. 

As you prepare for the next rounds, remember that practice and reflection are key. Embrace this journey, learn from each experience, and trust in your abilities. You’ve got this, and I’m confident that with the right preparation, you’ll shine in your upcoming interviews. 

**Always keep in mind that each interview is just one step in your career path, and there are many opportunities ahead.**
